# Ch 1: Strategy
1. WELCOME

    This info course is designed to help you kick off your job search! We can't make any guarantees about how long it's going to take you to find a programming job, but we can do everything in our power to make sure you're being as effective as possible in your search.

    PREREQUISITES

    You probably shouldn't be here unless at least one of the following is true:
    You've completed everything up to this point in the backend career path on Boot.dev
    You've had a job as a programmer before
    You have a CS degree or the educational equivalent

    LEARNING GOALS FOR THIS COURSE

    Build a job-ready GitHub profile
    Build a professional LinkedIn profile
    Build a resume that will cut through the noise
    Prepare you with a plan for applying, interviewing, networking, and even negotiating

2. LEARN, BUILD, AND APPLY

    Before we get into the nitty-gritty of portfolio preparation, I want to draw your attention to something critically important:
    Do not stop learning and building as you apply for jobs!
    I've seen so many prospective engineers "complete" their education, be it a degree, an online course, or a physical boot camp, and then stop learning. They stop building. They stop growing. They spend a few months applying, get discouraged, and then give up completely.

    DO NOT DO THIS.

    Every new thing you learn, every new bit of effort you put into your projects and open-source contributions make the job search that much easier. There's a compounding effect.

    BE MINDFUL OF YOUR TIME

    Let's say you have 10 hours each week to dedicate to your future programming career. I recommend spending roughly half of that time continuing to learn and build, and the other half doing job-search activities.
    Don't get me wrong, you should still be spending a good amount of time each week getting your resume in front of people by applying, networking, and interviewing. But if you spend all of your time doing that, you're going to burn out, and each month that passes without writing code is actually going to make it harder and harder to get a job.
    Instead, if you have a healthy balance of learning/building and applying/networking, your search will get easier over time. You'll be more confident in your skills, you'll have more to talk about in interviews, and you'll have more to show off on your resume.

3. PROVIDE SIGNAL

    Your #1 job as a job-seeker is to provide a signal to potential employers. Signal is the opposite of noise. Noise is all the stuff that doesn't matter. Signal is the stuff that does.
    Recruiters, HR reps, hiring managers, and future teammates are all looking for signals. They're looking for reasons to hire you. They're looking for reasons to not hire you. Your job is to make it as easy as possible for them to find the signal and ignore the noise.

    AN EXAMPLE OF NOISE

    I love to write code and walk my dogs on the beach. I know JavaScript, Python, Go, and Ruby, and I love building applications that are user-friendly and scalable. I would love to work for your company and make your team a success.
    The paragraph above says nothing interesting! There's nothing there that will perk up the ears of a recruiter or hiring manager. It's just a bunch of noise, and it sounds like every other resume in the pile.

    AN EXAMPLE OF SIGNAL

    I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Go project, "stackwrapr". The consolidated toolchain makes me want to leave the JavaScript ecosystem behind for good. I would love to work with you on the telemetry team at SrcChain because I've always been interested in monitoring production systems. I even noticed you're using ElasticSearch, which I've been toying with in my spare time!
    
    The above at least has a few things going for it:
    It's focused on tech. No one cares about your dogs.
    It has personality. You're not another schmuck claiming to know 10 languages. You're demonstrating experience through your opinions and categorizing yourself as a specialist in Go.
    It's specific. It's not "I can make your company better" it's I can make your team better because I have been learning about this specific thing.
    It sounds like a real, unique, bonafide person. It's not a robot regurgitating a bunch of buzzwords in a list.

    THINK ABOUT PROVIDING SIGNAL

    As we go through the rest of this course creating a GitHub profile, adding documentation to projects, and writing a resume, think about how you can provide a signal every step of the way.
    Everything you write and present to employers should signal that you're a real human who works hard, wants to learn more, and can solve real problems.

4. PITY

    This might sound a bit harsh, but it's certainly worth pointing out: no one is looking to do you any favors. Well, strangers aren't looking to do you favors. (That's why networking is important and we'll talk about it later).
    I've worked as a hiring manager in the past, and occasionally I would get DMs, cover letters or emails that contain a sob story. Something like:
    I've been trying to get my first programming job for 2 years, and I'm really struggling. Please consider me for this role.
    I'm not gonna lie, some of these messages tug on my heartstrings, but as a professional, there is nothing I can do with this information. What am I going to do? Kick the more qualified candidate to the curb just because they didn't write a sad story? If I were to do that I'd not only be making my own job harder, but I'd also be discriminating arbitrarily, which I think has troubling ethical implications.
    So, in reality, all the message above does is tell me "hey, no one wants to hire me". Which, when you think about it, it's a red flag.
    You don't start a date by telling the other person that no one wants to date you. It makes you look bad. Don't start a professional conversation that way either.
# Ch 2: Projects
1. PORTFOLIO PROJECTS
The single most important thing on your resume, aside from past work experience as a programmer (which you don't have if this will be your first job), is your portfolio projects.
Portfolio projects are a stand-in for work experience. The goal is to demonstrate to employers that you've built real projects that solve real problems. You've already built a few projects in Boot.dev, and maybe even a few more on your own. Let's take a look at them now. Maybe what you have is good enough, but maybe you need to think about building something new, or modify and enhance what you have.
YOU WANT TO STAND OUT
Most first-time job seekers are building the same old stuff: TODO apps, CRUD servers, Spotify clones, Command line calculators
These are fine projects for learning, but they're not going to impress a hiring manager. They're not going to make you stand out from the crowd.
PICK SOMETHING UNIQUE
When I was in college, I won a little hackathon with a Python script that analyzed an .mp3 file and found the "loudness spikes". It then generated some sheet music representing the drum beat of the song. The end result was you could play a drum beat into a microphone, and it would generate sheet music for you.
I'm not saying you should build that project, but it's a good example of something unique and interesting, and I was passionate about it because I'm a drummer. This kind of project will get hiring managers thinking:
"I wonder what technologies they used to build that?"
"How accurate is the detection? I want to try!"
CONSIDER DIFFERENT PROJECT TYPES
Assuming you're interested in a job in back-end development, there are several main project categories:
A command line tool
A web server
A web app
A library
If one of your main portfolio projects can be a library, I think that's fantastic! The nice thing about libraries is that they demonstrate a deeper understanding of software engineering. By developing a library you're forced to think:
How will another developer use my code?
How will I document my code?
How will I make my library easy to extend and modify?
Applications can be Frankenstein'd together more easily than a good library in my opinion. Just some food for thought.

2. HOW MANY PROJECTS?
Assuming you're pre-first-job, I think 2 is the right number, maybe 3. It's better to have a smaller number of projects that stand out than a larger number of mediocre projects. Make a decision on which 2 or 3 of your projects deserve to be shown off to hiring managers.
PRIMARY PROJECT
Additionally, only one will be your primary project. It's the one you should put the lion's share of your effort into, and it will be the one you list first on your resume.
Go ahead and choose a primary project. We'll be referencing that one through the rest of this course, but be sure to apply the same improvement ideas to all of your projects.
Submit the link to your primary project.
3. README
The single most important part of your portfolio project is the README.md found at the root of your project (GitHub will render it automatically on your repo page if it exists). It's the first thing that hiring managers will see when they click through to your project.
In many cases, hiring managers won't even take the time to look at your code, let alone clone and run it. The README.md is your chance to "wow" them and convince them that you're worth their time.
SECTIONS OF A GOOD README
A good README.md has a few sections:
Title
Description
"Why?" (Motivation/Goal/Problem to solve)
Quick Start
Usage
Contributing
We will look at each of these in detail, but for now, let's just get a good title.
TITLE SECTION
Give your project a good name! Don't name it "project", "API server", or "test app". Give it a name that's unique and memorable. Personality is useful here.
MARKDOWN FORMATTING
Use this Markdown Reference to help you format your README. Your title should be an H1 (heading 1, the largest heading). You should then use H2s and H3s to organize the rest of your README into a nice hierarchy.
Submit the link to your project's GitHub repo after you've added a title using an H1 heading.
4. DESCRIPTION
Use a couple of sentences to explain exactly what your project is. Don't be vague. Don't be generic. Try to say it in as simple a way as possible.
At all stages of the job search, refrain from minimizing or diminishing your work! Don't say:
This is just a toy app
This is just a test project
This is for practice
Give your projects the respect they deserve. Do not say "just". Say something like:
This is zipzod! A command-line tool for zipping and unzipping files with an ultra low memory footprint.
EXAMPLES
Wrapper of rabbitmq/amqp091-go that provides reconnection logic and sane defaults
-- go-rabbitmq
The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework based on The Elm Architecture. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.
-- bubbletea
IMAGES
If it makes sense, include a demo of your project in gif or video form! You can embed a GIF of your project "doing the thing" here. Bubble Tea's repo has a great example of this:
5. WHY?
Use a paragraph or two to describe why someone should care about your project. The description section was about the "what", this is the "why". For example,
There are a lot of ways to zip and unzip files, but none of them use so little memory! Zipzip is the zipping tool you need for working on low-memory devices like Raspberry Pis. I use a Raspberry Pi as a home server, and I was frustrated by my inability to easily manage large files on a small device, so I built zipzod.
You can title this section whatever you want. I've used "motivation" or "goals" before.
MORE EXAMPLES
```markdown
1. HTMX
* Why should only <a> and <form> be able to make HTTP requests?
* Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
* Why should only GET & POST be available?
* Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a hypertext

2. python-websockets
The development of websockets is shaped by four principles:

* Correctness: websockets is heavily tested for compliance with RFC 6455. Continuous integration fails under 100% branch coverage.
* Simplicity: all you need to understand is msg = await ws.recv() and await ws.send(msg). websockets takes care of managing connections so you can focus on your application.
* Robustness: websockets is built for production. For example, it was the only library to handle backpressure correctly before the issue became widely known in the Python community.
* Performance: memory usage is optimized and configurable. A C extension accelerates expensive operations. It's pre-compiled for Linux, macOS and Windows and packaged in the wheel format for each system and Python version.
```
MAKE IT A STORY
Remember, you're trying to grab attention here! This section should feel like a little story.
I had problem A and I tried B but it didn't work because C. I built D and now I can do E with ease!
6. QUICK START
If the reader is interested enough in the "what" and the "why", now it's time to show them "how"! This section should be the minimum amount of information they need to run your project.
This section doesn't talk about how to build the project, contribute to it, or explain every individual feature included. This is about using it, and using it quickly. So it could be something like:
## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install zipzod using the Go toolchain

```bash
go install github.com/xyz/zipzod@latest
```

## Run zipzod with an input directory and an output file

```bash
zipzod -i ./input -o ./output.zip
```

Or, if you've deployed the project to a server, it could be something like:
## 🚀 Quick Start

Navigate to [zipzod.xyz](https://zipzod.xyz) and upload your file!

You'll get a download link when it's done.

EXAMPLES
discordgo
discord.py (broken down into "installing" and "Quick Example" sections)
7. USAGE
This is where you'll want to show off more of the advanced features of your project. Think of this as the larger reference manual, or the comprehensive technical documentation. For example:
## 📖 Usage

Available flags:

* `-i` - The input file or directory
* `-o` - The output file or directory
* `-v` - Verbose output
* `-h` - Show help
* `-p` - The number of parallel workers to use (default 4)
* `-d` - The maximum depth to traverse (default 1)
* `-f` - The file extensions to include (default .txt, .md)

## Examples

Unzip a file

```bash
zipzod -i ./input.zip -o ./output
```

Zip with a different number of workers

```bash
zipzod -i ./input -o ./output.zip -p 8
```

A benefit of this section is that it shows off how much work you've put into this project. Look at all those features!
8. CONTRIBUTING
This section should help the reader understand how they can contribute, or more likely in your case, how they can build your project, make sure it works, run the tests, etc. If a hiring manager is interested in your project, they might want to pull it down and play with it.
For example, it could look something like this:
## 🤝 Contributing

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyz/zipzod@latest
cd zipzod
```

### Build the project

```bash
go build
```

### Run the project

```bash
./zipzod -i ./input -o ./output.zip
```

### Run the tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Submit a pull request

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and open a pull request to the `main` branch.

ASSIGNMENT
Make sure all of your Markdown is rendering correctly and that you're proud of your work.
When you're happy with your README, commit and push your changes to GitHub!
# Ch 3. GitHub Profile
1.GITHUB PROFILE
Now that you have one or two projects on your GitHub that you're proud of, it's time to make sure your GitHub profile as a whole is ready to go. Let's start by just making sure that you have a profile page that makes you look like a legitimate human being.
Remember, our goal is to provide signal. You don't want to be mistaken for a bot, a hobbyist, or a student. You want to be taken seriously.
Add a profile picture of yourself
Take the time to take a good one.
Smile. Look like a happy person, not someone that's pissed that they're taking a photo
It should be of your face, not a shot of you walking away from the camera on the beach
If you really don't want your picture online, at least add something that will make you seem likely to be a real person. Don't leave the default, and don't use a bored ape NFT.
Add your full name as it appears on your resume
Make your GitHub handle (username) something that you're not embarrassed by. Ideally, it's just your name or a close variant of it.
Add a short bio. Try to make it technical and unique to you. You can plug your favorite programming language or technology there if you want.
Add your location. This will really help when you're applying to local companies.
The simple act of filling out all the fields makes you look like a real person! Bot accounts don't take the time.

2.PROFILE README
GitHub recently added an amazing feature that allows you to write Markdown that renders directly on your profile page. It's a way to essentially add an extended bio.
You can add a README to your profile by creating a repo with the same name as your GitHub username and adding a README.md to that repo. That README will be rendered on your profile page. It’s driven completely by convention. Here’s an example of my repo and it renders here.
You should think of this section like you would the "intro" section on a resume. I'd keep it fairly short: a paragraph or two, or maybe just a list of bullet points.
For example, this might be the place for a high-signal technical introduction about your technical life:
I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Go project, "stackwrapr". The consolidated toolchain makes me want to leave the JavaScript ecosystem behind for good.
I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!

3.PINNING REPOS
You have the option to pin repositories to your GitHub profile. You should absolutely do this for your 2-3 portfolio projects, and maybe even some of your other projects if you're proud of them.
Make sure you order your pins from most important to least important. Most people will only click on the first one.
4.GITHUB HEATMAP
A great heatmap isn't necessary, but it certainly doesn't hurt. If your heatmap looks bare, you should figure out what's wrong in your workflow that's preventing your work from being tracked properly.
Are you not committing often enough?
Are you not pushing often enough?
Are you not storing all your code in GitHub?
Is your heatmap not public, or are your settings not showing commits to private repos?
Over time, if you're doing all of these things, your heatmap will fill up and look great. You want to be coding at least several days a week, and it's awesome if that shows here. This is what I'd expect the heatmap of an employed developer to look like:

Yours doesn't need to look like this, but #goals, right?
5.STARS
You don't need stars on your GitHub repos, but it certainly can't hurt. When I see that a candidate maintains a GitHub repo with more than even just 20 stars, I think, "Hey! Some people are using this thing!"
I wouldn't spend too much time marketing your projects for stars, but once you've got some projects you're proud of, and they have good READMEs, feel free to share them in a non-spammy way on Twitter, Reddit, Discord servers, Slack communities, or anywhere else you hang out online. If people like your project, they'll give it a star.
You might even get some feedback on your project! Be sure to consider that feedback and act on it to improve your stuff. Every time your projects get better, your job search becomes that much easier.
# Ch 4. LinkedIn Profile
1.LINKEDIN PROFILE
Aside from your GitHub, your LinkedIn is probably your 2nd most important social presence when hunting for jobs. I think of LinkedIn as a public copy of my resume with some additional messaging features. A lot of the stuff we talk about in this chapter will apply to your resume as well in the next chapter. Fear not! You won't have to do twice the work.
Let's hammer out the basics first. As with GitHub, you want to appear like a human who cares about their craft. Take the time to thoughtfully fill out your profile:
Add a profile picture (you should already have a good one from the last chapter)
Add your location
Add a background image. Do you have a picture of you doing something interesting? Maybe at the beach? At a conference? Ideally, it features you, but worst-case scenario you can use something generic like the city skyline where you live or some scenery.
If you have an impressive ACT/SAT/GPA feel free to add it to the test scores section
Join some groups related to your career interests, e.g. "Go Developer Community", "Python Programming", etc. These will show at the bottom of your profile.
If you've participated in any hackathons or won any relevant awards, add them to your profile in that section
Add your 2-3 GitHub portfolio projects to the "projects" section
Add contact info. If you don't have a personal site, just use your GitHub profile.
We'll hit the bigger sections in later exercises.
EXAMPLES OF GOOD LINKEDIN PROFILES

Miriah Peterson
2.EDUCATION SECTION
If you have a degree of some kind, obviously you should list it under the education section. If you don't have any higher education, I'd probably still list a high school diploma or GED if you have it.
If you don't have a CS degree (or even if you do tbh) our Boot.dev LinkedIn page is registered as a school, so you can list Boot.dev under your education section as well!
Finally, if you have any licenses or additional certifications, you can list those directly as well, here's some info on how to do that.
3.EXPERIENCE
Be sure to add the past few companies you worked at, and the roles you had there. Obviously, it's ideal if it's tech-related, or tech-adjacent, but if not, that's okay. It's better to have something here than nothing.
If you haven't worked as a programmer, the best thing you can do is at least show that you're a hard worker, reliable, that sort of thing.
BEING TECH-ADJACENT IS AN ADVANTAGE
If you have experience in QA, product management, IT Ops, or anything that's at least related to software development, update the descriptions of each of your past positions to emphasize any part of your job that was related to software development.
For example, for an IT Ops job, you might say something like:
* Worked closely with the development team to ensure that the software was deployed and running smoothly.
* Wrote custom code to automate deployments
* Built a SlackBot to provide real-time updates on the status of the production environment


Instead of:
* Managed production environment upgrades
* Installed databases
* Analyzed logs to troubleshoot issues

BE SPECIFIC AND INTERESTING
No matter what, try to make every line of text you publish (whether it's on LinkedIn, GitHub, or your resume) interesting and specific. It will attract more attention, garner follow-up questions, and generally just make you a more interesting person to work with.
DON'T SAY THIS
Worked on a backend REST API
Worked on a collaborative team and practiced leadership skills
Used Python and JavaScript to build an app that tracks data
SAY THIS INSTEAD
Built a media uploading service using Kubernetes, Docker and Go that handled 1,000 files per second. It replaced the old service that struggled to handle 100 files per second.
I led an initiative on my team to develop a plan to streamline our QA process for our React Native mobile app. We reduced the average turnaround time for a pull request approval by 50%.
I built a full-stack Django app that pulls weather data in real-time and sends alerts to subscribed users in geographic areas at risk of severe weather.
# Ch 5. Resume
1. RESUME
Your resume is critically important, which hopefully goes without saying.
I recommend working on your resume somewhere that's easily accessible and updateable. I use Google Docs. The nice thing about something like Google Docs is you can easily give a friend a link to it, and they can drop comments on it and collaborate with you.
SENDING YOUR RESUME
When you send your resume to an employer, I recommend sending it as a PDF. That's for a few reasons:
No one will accidentally edit it
It can be opened on any device easily (browsers open PDFs these days)
It looks the same on every device
Some people have issues with the various .doc and .docx formats.
Go ahead and open a new blank Google doc and let's get started.
2.TEMPLATE
It's actually fairly important (at least in my opinion) that your resume is visually appealing and unique. It's not a design contest, but think about it: your resume is going to be in a digital stack of 30 other resumes. If the other 29 are black text on white background with 12-point font, even just adding a splash of color to yours will make it stand out. We're all about standing out.
Here are a few resume templates that can be a good starting point. Feel free to use one, or to find/create your own. Pick something that you think looks good, and that you think will make you stand out just a little bit.
Splash of red
Bit of blue
Structured Orange
Good with green
Monospace
Keep in mind that these aren't good examples of content, they are just ideas for design and layout.
Find a template and copy it into your Google doc, then move on to the next step.
3.STRUCTURE
Think of your resume as a landing page on a website. You've got just a few moments to capture the attention of the reader. Putting the most important stuff at the top, and making it hard to miss, is critical.
If you've never had a job in tech, I'd recommend a structure like this, from top to bottom:
Name + contact info
About me
Skills
Portfolio Projects
Education
Experience
If you have had a job in tech, I'd recommend a structure like this, from top to bottom:
Name + contact info
About me
Skills
Experience
Education
Portfolio Projects
In a nutshell, you're putting your best stuff towards the top. If this is your first job, your portfolio projects are your best stuff. If you've had a job in tech, your work experience is your best stuff.
Get those sections in place, and then we'll work on the details.
4.CONTACT INFORMATION
At the top of your resume, you should have your name and contact information. There are just a few things I want to point out:
Use your full name, and make it prominent. I don't want to have to search for your name.
Your email is the next most important thing. While not required, it's best if you have a professional-looking email address. For example, first.last@gmail.com is better than slayerl0rd69@gmail.com
Your GitHub profile. Make it a clickable link
Your LinkedIn profile, again, make it a clickable link
Your phone number
Some folks are concerned that they'll get spam calls, spam emails, etc. by listing all this personal info on their resume. My take? That's the least of your concerns. You can block a spam call or email. You do not want to miss out on a job opportunity because you didn't make it easy for a recruiter to contact you.
5.ABOUT ME
A quick paragraph near the top of your resume is a great place to tell a quick story about what makes you a great candidate. You really wanna nail this.
Don't make the mistake of talking about your hobbies or passion for Indian cuisine here. Take advantage of these few sentences to sell your story and all the hard work you've put in to get to this point as a developer.
DON'T DO THIS:
I'm a developer who writes Go and Python. I love to hang out with my family and write code in my spare time. I'm looking for a great company to work for.
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS INSTEAD:
I discovered a love for software engineering 3 years ago when I stumbled onto a book about Python and started writing little scripts to automate some of my daily tasks as a middle school teacher. I love teaching but it just doesn't pay the bills these days and I was having so much fun writing code. Now, with several big projects under my belt, and having completed several rigorous online computer science courses, I'm making a full time switch to backend web development.
Coding had always just been a hobby for me, I'd write little projects here and there to keep track of D&D campaigns, but I hadn't considered it as a career path. After a couple of years as a waiter, I realized I had a talent for this coding stuff and decided to go about learning the right way and take some in-depth CS and backend development courses. Now that I've completed those and have several real-world projects under my belt, I'm excited for a full time career in software engineering.
I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Go project, "stackwrapr". I was playing around in the world of React/Next.js for awhile but Go's consolidated toolchain makes me want to leave the JS ecosystem behind for good. I'm currently looking for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly.
Write this up and add it to your resume. Also, feel free to paste it into the #job-help channel in Discord and we'll give you feedback!
6.SKILLS
I like to include some kind of "skills" section. It shouldn't take up much room, but it's essentially just a list of technologies that you're familiar with. I frankly don't think it's all that useful to the hiring manager, but often time non-technical recruiters or HR folks will scan for keywords, and you want to make sure you're not filtered out unfairly.
I typically include something like this:
Go, Python, JavaScript
PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB
Docker, GCP, AWS
Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
I don't want to take up too much vertical space, so I break up each bullet point into lists of related technologies.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO QUALIFY YOUR SKILLS
I see some resumes that look like this:
Go (advanced)
Python (intermediate)
Or this:
Go 4/5
Python 3/5
What am I supposed to understand from this as a hiring manager? What does "3/5" mean??? I have no idea. If you feel like you have a basic proficiency in something, list it. You can always explain more in detail about your experience with technologies once you're in the interview.
FOCUS ON THE STUFF FOR THE JOB YOU WANT
When you apply for a full-stack Python job, make sure to emphasize those skills. If you're applying for a back-end Go job, again, make sure to emphasize those skills. If your list is feeling long, remove the least applicable stuff. When I'm hiring a Go developer for the backend I would rather see this:
Go, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL
...
Than this:
Go, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Java, JavaScript, C# C, C++, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Python, ...
At least, I'd rather see that from a junior developer. When you list too many things, you start to water down your perceived proficiency in each of them.
7.PROJECTS
Assuming you're looking for your first job as a programmer, this is the most important section of your resume. It's the section that will get you the interview, and maybe even the job. You should already have your projects listed in your portfolio, so this should be easy.
Each project entry should look something like this:
Name of project. Again, it's best if the names of the projects are unique and memorable!
Link to the project on GitHub. Make this link clickable.
A short description of the project. This can be the same as the what/why descriptions on the project's readme.
The tech stack and technologies used in the project.
Additionally:
Don't be afraid to use at least a paragraph or two for each project. This is the most important section for you if you don't have professional experience!
Ideally, you have 2 projects here. 3 is pushing it.
DO NOT SAY "JUST"
Don't use words like "just", "toy" or "followed a tutorial" to describe your projects. Don't downplay your work. If your work sucks, make it better, then come back and stop downplaying it.
Watch this ~60-second clip from the Backend Banter podcast where James Q Quick talks about new developers downplaying their work:
EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of good project entries:
go-rabbitmq

https://github.com/wagslane/go-rabbitmq

I built this wrapper of `rabbitmq/amqp091-go` to provide reconnection logic and sane defaults when working with RabbitMQ. The `amqp091-go` library is currently the most robust and well-supported Go client that I'm aware of. It's a fantastic option, but it's fairly low-level and stays within the scope of the AMQP protocol, as such, few quality of life features exist for RabbitMQ users.

Go-rabbitmq provides most of the nitty-gritty functionality of Streadway's AMQP, but makes it easier to work with via a higher-level API. Go-rabbitmq is also built specifically for Rabbit, not for the more general AMQP protocol.


tinytime

https://github.com/wagslane/go-tinytime

I built this library to make it convenient to work with lightweight timestamps in Go. The standard library's `time.Time` type uses ~24 bytes of data in memory. I was working on a project where I needed to store hundreds of thousands of timestamps in memory, and I wanted to reduce the memory footprint of my application.

TinyTime uses just 4 bytes of memory per timestamp, and can be converted to and from a standard `time.Time` object. It matches the time.Time API as closely as possible, with a tradeoff of some functionality. For example, TinyTime does not support timezones, and only supports dates between `1970` and `2106`.
8.EDUCATION
This section should be fairly straightforward. List your highest level of education, and include any impressive achievements, grades, test scores, or certifications.
If you have a degree, even if it's not CS-related, list it.
If you have particularly good grades or impressive test scores, list them. (e.g. ACT/SAT)
If you have any impressive official certifications, list them. (e.g. AWS Certified Developer Associate)
List your Boot.dev education!
List Boot.dev on your resume and link to your public Boot.dev profile (make sure it's filled out!). I also recommend adding some explanatory text in case the person reading isn't familiar with the program. Something like this:
Boot.dev
https://boot.dev/u/wagslane
Dec 2022 - Oct 2023
Successfully completed Boot.dev, a rigorous computer science and backend engineering program. I finished over 20 courses and projects, including courses on DSA, OOP, functional programming, web servers, and SQL databases to name a few.
9.WORK EXPERIENCE
I know I mentioned this before in the LinkedIn section, but I want to reiterate it here: you don't need to have had a job in tech to have work experience. If you've had a job in any field, you have work experience, and you should list it. You probably don't need to go into a ton of detail about your role as a Bank Teller, but you should list it.
Hiring managers still want to know that you're responsible enough to have held-down jobs. You can still communicate soft skills like hard work, responsibility, and communication skills through your non-coding work experience.
GETTING SOME EXPERIENCE
The hardest coding job to get is your first one. Someone has to take a chance on you because you don't have a track record of working on a team. The second job is usually like 10x easier to get than the first one in my experience.
However, there are some tricks for finagling some work experience that you can slap on your resume.
DO WORK FOR FREE
I would not recommend picking up an unpaid internship that requires you to quit your current job. However, maybe you can help a local non-profit or small business with some of their technical needs. Maybe it's a website. Maybe it's a script that automates part of their workflow. Maybe it's a server application that pulls data from their Google Sheets and emails it to them every morning. Whatever.
The point is, if you can build them a real solution that they actually use, you can put that on your resume. It doesn't matter that you weren't paid. We don't list salaries on our resumes anyway.
I love this ~90-second clip from the Backend Banter podcast where Bill Kennedy talks about hacking your way into some experience:
CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE
While not required, this is one of the most under-utilized tools for providing signal to employers that you know what you're doing. Think about it: if your pull requests have been merged into a popular open-source project that's used in production by real companies, that's a great indication that you know what you're doing. Depending on the size of the contribution it can be as good as or even better than work experience.
The trick is to make sure your contribution is significant. Don't just fix a typo in the docs. Add a new feature or fix a bug (and add tests for the bug). Make it something you can proudly list on your resume, and that you're happy to talk about in an interview.
# Ch 6: Applying
1.START APPLYING
It's time to get going! You've got all you need to start the process of cold applying to companies. There are strategies aside from cold applying that we'll talk about later, but I'm a believer in cold applying as well. It doesn't take a ton of time, and frankly, most of my jobs as a developer came from cold applying.

SET A WEEKLY GOAL
I sent about 100 resumes out before landing my first full-time developer job. I did that over a 6-week period. Pick a number of applications you want to complete on a weekly basis as your goal. Make sure that it's high enough that you're getting yourself out there, but that it's low enough that you'll have the time to put in the effort needed to make each application good.
For example, sending 25 applications each week (~3/4 each day) is a great goal. You can spend 30 minutes each day on it, and you'll start getting some feedback from companies.
DON'T WAIT
Don't wait! There's no reason to put this off. The worst thing that can happen is that you don't hear back. There are millions of companies out there, and you only need one to say yes, so you might as well get started.
2.WHERE TO APPLY
There are, of course, all the "normal" places to find jobs. Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, AngelList etc. You should be looking at those, and using them to find jobs to apply to. However, they shouldn't be your only source of job applications. Everyone is applying to the top 50 jobs that show up when you type "backend developer" on LinkedIn. That doesn't mean you can't apply to those, but you should also be looking for other places to apply.
LOCAL AREA
With the whole world going remote, so many candidates forget that there are onsite-only jobs out there. In fact, there are a lot of them! There are a few great advantages to applying for local jobs:
The candidate pool is much smaller
You can meet these folks in person, maybe even at a meetup for coffee
You can get a sense of the company culture by visiting the office
If you get the job, you'll be able to work with your coworkers and mentors in person, meaning you'll learn faster
ON COMPANY WEBSITES
Most companies have a /careers page on their website. If they're hiring, you can browse the jobs there. By going directly to a company's website, it's much more likely that you'll be applying to a job with a smaller candidate pool because this job may not be posted on one of the major job boards, or may simply not be coming to the top of the list when people search.
Think of all the different companies you would like to work for and go directly to their websites to see if they're hiring.
ON NICHE JOB BOARDS
There are smaller job boards out there that will have far fewer applicants than the big ones. You'll want to dig on your own, but in the past I've used:
RemoteOK
Golang cafe
WeWorkRemotely
Work at a Startup
Hacker News Monthly "Who's Hiring" thread
Key Values
Local Slack/Discord communities (don't spam, look for some kind of #jobs channel)
NON-TECH COMPANIES
I've noticed that a lot of developers get their "first programming job" at a non-tech company. These are companies that employ developers, but the product they sell isn't software. For example:
A local marketing agency that needs a developer or two to build custom solutions for marketing analytics
A local manufacturing company might need a developer to maintain a custom inventory management system
A local accounting firm might have a home-grown invoicing system that needs new features
You can potentially get a great year or two of experience at a company like this, and then move on to a more traditional tech company once you have some experience under your belt. It won't pay as well, but it will pay and can be a great way to stair-step your way into a more traditional tech job.
3.FIND SIDE DOORS
There is a saying that goes something like:
When the front door has a line around the block, find the side door.

When you're going about finding places to apply, try to find some side doors. Often time official job postings will have hundreds of applicants, but there are other ways to get your foot in the door. You don't need to do this with every job, cold applying through the front door should certainly be part of your strategy. However, when a side door presents itself, you should take advantage of it.
EXAMPLES OF SIDE DOORS
A friend works at a tech company in sales, knows they're hiring, and can name-drop you to the hiring manager
A developer mentions their company is hiring in a local Slack channel. You offer to buy them a coffee to learn more
The company that you work for currently as a customer support rep has developers on staff. You offer to buy one of the developers a coffee to learn more about their job and if they're hiring
Walk into a local company's office to drop off your resume (you should send it in the normal way too, but this can get you noticed)
4.RECRUITERS
Recruiters can be a fantastic way to land jobs, but they can also be a huge waste of time. When you're a highly sought-after senior developer with 6 years of experience, recruiters will bend over backward to get you hired because their commissions will be fat. Seriously, they can make 30% of your yearly salary just to get you hired. However, for your first job, it's far less likely that a recruiter will be helpful.
It won't hurt you to interact with a couple of recruiters when they reach out on LinkedIn, but you might find that they're asking you to compile all sorts of information, do homework projects, and hop on calls, and just end up ghosting you in the end. Here's the reality: recruiters make money from commissions, and the commissions for placing entry-level candidates are essentially non-existent. Recruiters will often bulk DM everyone on LinkedIn with the keyword "Python" in their profile, and then try to get the responders to do the work of eliminating themselves from the pool.
My takeaway? Chat with some recruiters if they reach out to see how it goes. At the very least it's a good learning experience, but don't expect much from them if you're looking for your first role.
# Ch 7: Networking
1.NETWORKING
Yuck. "Networking" sounds like a dirty word used by frat bros and salespeople. The thing is, it is a great way to get a job, but there is a bad way to do it.
Networking is the ultimate side door. Having friends in the industry makes getting hired orders of magnitude easier, however, thinking about "networking" as "building a network of people that can help me" will not work.
THE KEY TO GOOD NETWORKING IS TO STOP NETWORKING
Networking is just corpo=speak for "making friends who share professional interests with you". If you think about it as a sleazy, transactional thing, you'll come off as sleazy and transactional, and you won't make friends. If you just apply your kindergarten teacher's advice on how to make friends, you'll be fine.
DO NOT:
Cold DM people asking for work
Join Discord servers and spam the #jobs channel
Show up at meetups and hand out business cards
DO:
Engage in conversations with folks on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, etc., about something they posted about
Help people out when they ask for help online
Go to meetups and talk to people about the talk that was just given
Make some friends. This takes time. Once you have some friends, you can ask them for help, or more likely, if they're aware of your goals, they'll offer to help you when they see an opportunity. Networking is critical, but it's a long-term play that will pay dividends for the rest of your career.
2.IN-PERSON MEETUPS
If you are near some physical tech meetups, this is by far the best networking activity you can do. Frankly, if you're not going to a local meetup (given that one is available to you), I'd question your commitment to getting a job.
WHY LOCAL MEETUPS ARE SO GOOD
Meeting in person builds a much stronger friendship more quickly than online
They are almost always free
You sometimes get free food
The people who attend meetups tend to be some of the most well-connected people in the local tech scene
You will learn a ton from the talks
I implore you. Check Meetup.com for local tech meetups. If you can go to one every week, you'll be in such a good spot. Most meetups meet monthly in the evenings, so try to find a few that you can go to regularly.
WHAT TO DO AT A MEETUP
Individual meetup events usually work like this:
People trickle in before the talk starts (try to sit by someone and say hi!)
~30-minute talk about a tech topic
People hang out and chat for ~30 minutes after the talk (this is the best time to meet people)
Your goal, again, should just be to get to know the people there. If you show up consistently, you'll figure out who the "regulars" are. Make sure you get to know them. Become a regular yourself. Make it known to the world that you're new to programming and you're looking for your first job, but don't ask favors of people you're just meeting for the first time. If they have advice or connections, they'll let you know once they get to know you better.
3.VIRTUAL MEETUPS
If you're not near any physical meetups, you can still attend virtual meetups. These are usually done over Google Hangouts, Zoom, or something similar. While a virtual meetup tends to be better than a simple Slack channel, I want to be clear: virtual meetups are not as good as in-person meetups.
Virtual is better than nothing. You'll still get to listen to talks and meet some folks, but they won't be as powerful from a networking perspective. If you have the option to go to a physical meetup, do that instead.
4.ONLINE COMMUNITIES
There are a lot of online communities out there for developers. I highly recommend finding 2 or 3 that you like and participating in them regularly. To be clear, you should not go find 20 different Slack communities related to programming, join them all, and spam their "welcome" channel with messages about how you're looking for a job. Not only is that not going to work, but it's going to get you blocked and banned as well.
Instead, I recommend a few things:
Join (if you haven't already) the Boot.dev Discord. This is the best place for you to get general-purpose job search help from our Boot.dev community
Join the official Discord/Slack/Forum for the programming language or framework you're most interested in working with professionally. For example, the Golang Slack or the Python Discord.
Join a Discord or Slack group for the tech scene in your local area
You will probably only have enough time to meaningfully connect with folks in 2 or 3 communities, so don't go overboard. Just like with physical meetups, the point here is to become a "regular" and get to know people. If you're a regular, and you make some friends, they'll be much more likely to help you out when an opportunity arises. This means not only asking for help but also offering help when you can.
5.SOCIAL MEDIA
I see a lot of folks spend a bunch of time on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social platforms trying to find job opportunities by writing posts, replying to posts, and DMing people. If you were going to be wasting a bunch of time doom scrolling Twitter anyway, maybe these sorts of activities are a productivity improvement, but I don't think they're a particularly good use of your time.
To be clear, I do think having a good LinkedIn profile is important, but I wouldn't spend a lot of time on the site trying to "connect" with random people in your feed. I also think Twitter can be a good place to learn about what's going on in the industry, but I also don't think it's a great place to find job opportunities for most people.
Spend time on social at your own risk. It can be a big time sink, and I would prioritize in-person meetups or tight-knit online communities over social networks.
# Ch 8: Interviews
1.INTERVIEWS
If you send 100 applications, you might get 15 phone screens, 10 interviews, and 1 offer. Those numbers are just estimates, but hopefully, it demonstrates that:
You need to send a lot of applications
You need to do a lot of interviews
Interviewing is a skill, and it's one that you can get better at with practice. My goals with this section are to help you get started on the right foot and to give you some pointers that will help you improve your interviewing skills faster.
LISTEN TO THIS EPISODE
You don't have to do this now, but I highly recommend listening to this full episode from the Backend Banter podcast at some point when you have free time. It's available on YouTube or any major podcasting app, and is just packed with advice for getting your first job as a developer from James Q Quick.
2.RELAX
I know, I know, just telling you to relax when you're sitting in an interview isn't going to make you relax, but it is important. If you're relaxed, you'll pay attention more easily, you'll recall information more easily, and you'll perform better in general. Here are a few things to keep in mind that should help you relax in interviews:
1. YOU PROBABLY AREN'T GETTING THIS JOB
Everyone interviews at far more companies throughout their careers than they work for. It's just a numbers game. Don't get too attached to the idea of working for this company that you're interviewing with. If you do, the pressure will be on, and you'll be more likely to make mistakes.
Instead, just think of it as a conversation. You're just getting to know each other. By all means, show enthusiasm for the company, but go into the interview with a mindset of connecting with the interviewers, practicing your interviewing skills, and learning a bit about the professional world of software development.
2. IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME
After an interview, if you find out that you didn't get the job, you'll still learn a lot from the time spent. For example:
You'll learn what an interview process looks like
You'll get practice solving technical problems and communicating your solutions
You'll learn about the company and what they do with their software
You'll learn about the tech stack they use, and which technologies are popular in your area
You'll find some of your own weaknesses and knowledge gaps that you can work on
3. YOU'LL GET MORE CHANCES
This isn't your one audition for America's Got Talent. If you don't make it, there are hundreds of other interviews to be conducted. It's most important that you're getting out there and practicing your interview skills.
The better a job you do with your applications, the more interviews you get. The more interviews you have, the less pressure you'll feel to nail the one you're in.
3.CONFIDENCE
Most new developers don't have nearly enough confidence in themselves during a coding interview, and it shows. I know it's not helpful to just tell you to be confident, but it is something that you can improve on with some effort and preparation.
FIRST, RECOGNIZE HOW FAR YOU'VE COME
Boot.dev is all about learning backend development the smart way. We don't take shortcuts. If you've made it this far and built all those projects, you've learned a lot. In most cases, you've probably learned more about the practical skills used in backend development than 4-year CS graduates. You've certainly learned more theory and computer science fundamentals than most 18-week bootcamp graduates.
COMPANIES DON'T HIRE PEOPLE, PEOPLE HIRE PEOPLE
Companies don’t think for themselves. Companies are made up of people, and the people in a company don’t belong to a singular hive mind. They don’t do exactly what’s in the company’s best interest at all times. The people in a company are loosely aligned in their mission to make the company money, but each person has their own wants, needs, pains and incentives.
People hire people who solve their problems. They're not always looking for the absolute best developer, they're looking for a coworker that will make their job easier. They want someone who will:
Save them time
Make them look good
Make their life easier
Build out their team, giving them more authority and influence
Deliver the project that will secure their next promotion
Be fun to work with
etc
Your interviewer will wonder:
Will I have to hold your hand constantly?
Will you learn the codebase and be able to contribute quickly?
Do you bring new skills to the team?
Will you be able to quickly learn the things you need to know but aren’t yet familiar with for this role?
Will hiring you make me look good?
THE POINT: DON'T BE A CHARITY CASE
My point is that you should avoid any sob stories or self-deprecating comments. I've conducted interviews where the candidate said things like:
I'm not very good at algorithms, I didn't have money for college
I've been applying for 2 years and I haven't gotten any offers yet
My best guess is that these candidates thought that we would feel sorry and pity-offer them a job. That's not going to happen. It's not because we don't care, or we were ruthless, but it would simply be bad business and frankly downright unethical to hire the less qualified person because they had a sad story.
You need to be showing off that you can solve problems and that you're a good person to work with. That does not mean you need to know everything, but it does mean you should present the best possible version of yourself.
4.HUMILITY
I know I just said you need to be confident in your abilities, and you do. You need to:
Be confident in your ability to learn, communicate, solve problems, and build solutions
Be humble about your current working set of knowledge
You're new to this! You don't know everything there is to know about programming, no one does. There's just too much to know, and your interviewers are aware of this.
HUMBLE FOLKS ARE FUN TO WORK WITH
Remember, a human is hiring you, and this human will have to work with you daily if they hire you. From a high level, they want 2 things:
You can do the job well so they don't have to hold your hand
You're enjoyable to work with so they don't dread coming to work
Know-it-alls are no fun to work with. They're arrogant, they don't listen, and they're not open to new ideas
Being humble communicates that you will be teachable and learn faster
Being humble means you’re more likely to be willing to adapt to how the team does things
5.STRUCTURE
The structure of your interview process will vary from company to company, but there are a few common steps that I can forewarn you about:
The phone screen
The homework assignment
The cultural interview
The technical interview
The offer
Larger companies tend to have more structure and longer processes. Small companies tend to have less structure and shorter processes.
1. THE PHONE SCREEN
If you're getting called, this means that your resume was chosen out of a big stack! Congratulations! You're already doing something right. This isn't an interview, it's just a phone call to get to know you a bit and to see if you're worth bringing in for an interview.
Sometimes this is done by a hiring manager (small company) but is often done by a recruiter or HR person (larger company). They'll ask you a few questions about your background, and they'll tell you a bit about the company and the position. This is a great time to ask questions about the company, the position, and the rest of the interview process.
It's very unlikely you'll be disqualified at this stage. The only reason I've disqualified candidates here in the past is because they were rude or there was a misunderstanding about the data on their resume.
2. THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
Not all companies send homework assignments, but some do, and it tends to be more common for junior or entry-level positions. Hopefully, it goes without saying, but do your best on any homework assignments you undertake. This is a stage where some percentage (maybe even a majority) of candidates are disqualified.
In descending order of importance:
Complete the task
Make it performant
Make sure your code is readable and well-organized
If you're in the fortunate position of having many companies wanting you to do homework assignments, be judicious. Don't do a bad job on 5 take-home assignments. Do a good job on 2-3 and either turn down the rest or ask for more time.
Be quick. Use the full time given, (it's common to be told not to spend more than 2 hours). But try to get to it, complete it, and turn it in quickly. This moves you to the top of the pile and shows that you're interested and motivated.
3. THE CULTURAL INTERVIEW
Some companies combine the cultural (soft skills) interview and the technical (hard skills) interview, but some separate them, or even have multiples of each.
This part of the interview won't contain tricky technical problems, it's really just:
Do we like this person?
Will we get along with them?
Will they fit in with the team?
Are they a good communicator?
Are they happy? Or a downer?
Hard worker? Responsible? Kind?
I don't have much more advice here, other than to relax and try to make a connection with the interviewer. Take interest in them, ask them questions, and try to find common ground. Classic stuff from the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People".
4. THE TECHNICAL INTERVIEW
I typically see these different types of technical interviews:
Whiteboarding problems (usually algorithms)
Live coding exercises (algorithms or small application features)
Architecture and design questions
Walkthroughs of past projects
We'll go into detail on each of these later.
In my experience, larger companies tend to do more whiteboarding and live coding, and smaller companies tend to do more architecture and walkthroughs. This is just a generalization, and there are exceptions. Large companies just want to hire the best possible developer, and smaller companies want to hire someone who can get to work quickly on the specific tech stack and projects they're working on.
5. THE OFFER
If you get an offer, congratulations! The one piece of advice I'll give here is to take a couple of days to "think" about it. You don't need to accept immediately. Ideally, you can get a second offer and make a choice, but even if you don't, take a day or two.
I will say that your first job doesn't need to be the sexiest high-paying job in the world. Sometimes it makes sense to take the base hit and you can always find a new job in a year or two. If you're in a position to be picky, then by all means, be picky. But if you're not, don't feel like you need to hold out for the perfect job. Getting experience on your resume is a big win.
6.BE ON THE TEAM
I think one of the best things you can do during a technical interview is to reframe the situation in your mind a little bit.
Rather than thinking of it as an exam, think of it as a collaboration. Generally, you're not being left high and dry by your interviewer, you're able to ask clarifying questions and suggest solutions rather than provide them. Let me show you some examples.
BAD EXAMPLE
Interviewer: "Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string reversed."
You: "Ok"
You: writes function
You: "Here you go"
GOOD EXAMPLE
Interviewer: "Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string reversed."
You: "Got it, how concerned about memory are we? Should I try to reverse the string in place, or should I create a new string?"
Interviewer: "Let's say we're not concerned about memory, we just want a solution that works."
You: writes signature of function
You: "We just want a single string in, single string out, right?"
Interviewer: "Yep"
You: while writing the rest of the function "Ok, so I'll just create a new string, loop through the input string backwards, and add each character to the new string.
This should handle cases of empty strings automatically."
KEY DIFFERENCES
The second example is better for many reasons:
You're asking clarifying questions
Which means you're less likely to write incorrect code
You're communicating your thought process
Which means your interviewer can help you if you get stuck
And means your interviewer gets to see you think, which provides more signal
And shows that you think through edge cases, something you'll need to do on the job
And shows that you're a great communicator, which is critical to being a good developer
You're using words like "we" and "us" instead of "you" and "me"
Which means your interviewer feels like you're on the same team
And means they will be more helpful and friendly
7.ASK QUESTIONS
Asking questions makes you look smart, not dumb. Smart people ask lots of questions. They're knowledge sponges. They want to learn as much as they can. People want to work with smart people.
TURN "I DON'T KNOW" INTO A CONVERSATION
Try to expound on "I don't know"s. If you don't have a textbook answer, try to explain what you do know, or mention a related topic that you know about.
BAD EXAMPLE
Interviewer: "What is a closure, and when would you use one?"
You: "I think it has to do with functional programming, but I don't know"
GOOD EXAMPLE
Interviewer: "What is a closure, and when would you use one?"
You: "I learned about closures when I took a course on functional programming, but I don't remember all the details. I do remember using them in my link aggregator project. Did it have something to do with functions and state?"
In the second example, the interviewer is informed that you have experience with functional programming, you've casually reminded them of a cool project you built, and you're asking a good follow-up question. Now they can guide you along instead of awkwardly moving on to the next question.
CLARIFY CLARIFY CLARIFY
It doesn't make you look dumb to ask clarifying questions. In fact, in the real world, the best developers ask a lot of clarifying questions from their product managers, designers, and other developers. It ensures they don't waste time building the wrong things. Here's a good example:
Interviewer: "Let's say you're designing a CRUD API to manage users and their photos. How would you design the endpoints?"
You: (after a ~5 second pause) "Hmm... are users allowed to share photos?"
Interviewer: "Good question... let's assume that users can share photos, but there is still a primary owner of each photo."
You: "Okay, well then I would probably have a /users endpoint to get information about specific users, and I would have a /users/:id/photos endpoint to get all the photos associated with each user. Would that work for our usecase?"
8.PREPARE
Once you've landed an interview, it makes a lot of sense to take an hour or so and do some preparation. I'd recommend doing the following for each interview you are taking seriously:
Research the company. Make sure you know what they do and who they do it for.
Research the tech they use. Try to figure out the programming languages, frameworks, and databases they work with.
Make sure you know all the technologies by name. You don't have to have used them all before, but make sure you know what they are and what they're used for.
If you have a lot of time before the interview, then going a little deeper into the individual technologies can be helpful. Try downloading them and building a little CLI tool with them can be a good idea. The point is, just an hour of prep can go a long way in making you feel much more confident and prepared.
9.PRACTICE
Alongside your job search, we've talked about how you should still be learning and building. If you're applying for larger companies, or you find that you're being asked to solve a lot of algorithmic problems in interviews, then it can also make sense to practice solving algorithmic problems. These kinds of problems most often come in the form of whiteboard interviews or live coding interviews.
Leetcode is a fantastic resource for this. It has a huge library of algorithmic problems. If you find yourself struggling in these kinds of interviews, then spend some time reviewing algorithms and data structures in the Boot.dev courses and practicing on Leetcode.

TAKE NOTES
At the end of the day, you should be spending your practice time on whatever you feel like you're struggling with most. After leaving an interview, quickly jot down some notes about any of the questions that you struggled with. Then, spend some time practicing and reviewing better answers so you'll never be stumped by that again.
You won't know what your weaknesses are until you do some interviews! So get out there and start interviewing.
# Ch 9: Location
1.RELOCATION
It tends to be easier to land in-person jobs than remote jobs as a junior developer. As you get more experience, you'll have the option to work remotely more easily, but for now, onsite is the way to go if you can swing it.
Now, I know many folks are not in a position to relocate, or just don't want to. No one is forcing you to move, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential benefits. After all, I relocated from a small town in Southern Utah to Salt Lake City for my first job, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
WHY RELOCATE?
If you're in a small town, then probably:
There aren't many developer jobs
The jobs that are available aren't at sexy tech companies
However, if you're in a tech hub like San Francisco, New York, or Seattle, then you probably have more options than you know what to do with. To be fair, there will likely also be more candidates competing for those jobs, but in my experience, the ratio of jobs to candidates is still better in tech hubs.
2.WHEN TO RELOCATE
Even if you're willing to relocate, I'd still recommend doing research and starting your job search long before you start packing your bags. I'd probably have a plan that looks like this:
Apply to local companies first
If that doesn't work, find 2-3 tech hubs you'd be willing to move to and start applying there
If that's not working, and you're confident your problems are due to your location, consider moving to one of those tech hubs and start applying again
See, it's always easier to get a job in a city where you already live. You can drive over for the interview. The company doesn't have to pay or wait for you to relocate. You can start sooner. It's just easier.
The trouble is, of course, that it's risky to move to a new city without a job offer in hand. You might have to work landscaping, retail, or food service to make ends meet while you continue your job search. I'm not telling you what to do here, I just want you to consider the pros and cons of each option.
I think for most people, it makes sense to start where you are, then try applying in other cities and being extremely clear that you're ready to relocate, if that doesn't work, then consider moving to one of those cities and continuing your job search.
3. IS IT THE LOCATION?
I want to point out, that if you're having trouble finding work, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's your location that's the problem. It could be. Before relocating, I'd recommend you get introspective on a few things:
Is your portfolio in a good place?
Do your LinkedIn, Resume, and GitHub all look fantastic?
Have you been applying to enough jobs?
If you're getting interviews, are you doing well in them?
Are you getting any feedback on why you're not getting offers?
Moving can be an expensive endeavor. Personally, I would want to be reasonably confident that I'm doing everything else well before I'd consider moving to a new city to restart my job search there.
4.IT'S YOUR LIFE
If you're single, in your 20s, and can survive in a new city with a random job at Starbucks then relocating can make a lot of sense. The risk is relatively low, and the reward is potentially high.
However, if you have 4 kids, a mortgage, and a job at the local high school, it can be incredibly risky to move without an offer in hand.
Do what you think is best for you and your family.
