//?Coding a game is a great way to grasp fundamental programming principles, while also creating an interactive gaming experience.

//?In this platformer game project, you'll continue to learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. You'll also learn how to design and organize game elements efficiently and gain insights into problem-solving and code reusability.

//?4 Before you can begin building out the functionality for the game, you will need to set up the ability to add 2D graphics.

//?4 The Canvas API can be used to create graphics in games using JavaScript and the HTML canvas element.

//?4 You will need to use the getContext method which will provide the context for where the graphics will be rendered.
