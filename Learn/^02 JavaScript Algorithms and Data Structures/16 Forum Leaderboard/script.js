//?Line1 JavaScript is an asynchronous programming language. And this project will help you gain proficiency in asynchronous concepts. You'll code your own freeCodeCamp forum leaderboard. This project will cover the Fetch API, promises, Async/Await, and the try..catch statement.

//?4 To populate the forum leaderboard with data, you will need to request the data from an API. This is known as an asynchronous operation, which means that tasks execute independently of the main program flow. You can use the async keyword to create an asynchronous function, which returns a promise.
// const example = async () => {
//   console.log("this is an example");
// };
