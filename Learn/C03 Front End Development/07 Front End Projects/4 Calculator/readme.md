This code defines a basic React-based calculator application with two main components: `Buttons` and `Calculator`. Here's a summary:

1. **`typedNumbers` Array**:
   - Acts as a temporary storage for entered numbers and operators.

2. **`Buttons` Component**:
   - Renders calculator buttons (digits, operators, and functionalities like "AC" and "=").
   - Each button triggers a corresponding function from `Calculator` via `this.props`.

3. **`Calculator` Component**:
   - Maintains the calculator's state, including the `display` value.
   - Handles core functionalities:
     - **`clearDisplay`**: Resets the display and clears `typedNumbers`.
     - **`updateDisplay`**: Updates the display with entered numbers.
     - **`operators`**: Manages operator input, preventing invalid sequences (e.g., multiple operators).
     - **`decimalOperator`**: Ensures decimals are correctly added based on context.
     - **`equalOperator`**: Evaluates the expression using `eval()` and updates the display.
   - Renders the calculator interface, including a display and the `Buttons` component.

4. **Features**:
   - Prevents leading zeroes.
   - Prevents consecutive operators (e.g., "5 * - + 5").
   - Allows a single decimal per numeric entry.
   - Dynamically updates the display.

5. **Issues**:
   - `eval()` is used for evaluation, which can introduce security concerns.
   - The handling of operator precedence and edge cases may need refinement (e.g., the sequence "5 * - + 5").

6. **Usage**:
   - The calculator UI is rendered into an HTML element with the ID `app`.
