#  Step  1 - 10
## Step 1
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.

One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the `let` keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a `hello` variable:

```js
let hello;
```
Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

Declare a `character` variable in your code.

Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. `;`
## Step 2
Your `character` variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator `=`. For example:
```js
let hello = "Hello";
```
Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

Initialize your `character` variable by assigning it the value `"Hello"` during its declaration.
## Step 3
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with `String` being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

Note that strings are *immutable*, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.

Change your `"Hello"` string to use single quotes.
## Step 4
The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using `console.log()`. For example, this code will print `"Naomi"` to the console:
```js
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);
```
The code above accesses the `developer` variable with its name in the `console.log()`. Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.

Print the value of the `character` variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.
## Step 5
When a variable is declared with the `let` keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of `programmer` is changed from `"Naomi"` to `"CamperChan"`.
```js
let programmer = "Naomi";
programmer = "CamperChan";
```
Note that when reassigning a variable that has already been declared, you do not use the `let` keyword.

After your `console.log`, assign the value `"World"` to your `character` variable.
## Step 6
Now log your `character` variable to the console again. You should see the string `"Hello"`, then the string `"World"`, in the console.
## Step 7
When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is *camel case*.

Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:
```js
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;
```
Use camel case to declare a new `secondCharacter` variable.
## Step 8
When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered *uninitialized*. Currently, your `secondCharacter` variable is uninitialized.

Add a `console.log()` to see what the value of your `secondCharacter` variable is.
## Step 9
The default value of an uninitialized variable is `undefined`. This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

You can still assign a value to an uninitialized variable. Here is an example:
```js
let uninitialized;
uninitialized = "assigned";
```
Assign the string `"Test"` to your `secondCharacter` variable below your declaration. Open the console to see how your log has changed.
## Step 10
You can also assign the value of a variable to another variable. For example:
```js
let first = "One";
let second = "Two";
second = first;
```
The `second` variable would now have the value `"One"`.

To see this in action, change your `secondCharacter` assignment from `"Test"` to your `character` variable.

Then open the console to see what gets logged.
#  Step 11 - 20
## Step 11
You are now ready to declare your next variable. Remove both `console.log` statements, and the `character` reassignment.

Also remove your `secondCharacter` variable, but leave the `character` initialization unchanged.
## Step 12
Use `let` to declare a `count` variable. Assign it the number `8`. When using a number value, you do not use quotes. For example:
```js
let money = 100;
```
## Step 13
With the `number` data type, you can perform mathematical operations, like addition. Try printing `count + 1` to the console.
## Step 14
You can also perform subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). Feel free to experiment with the operators and numbers in your `console.log`. When you are ready to move on, remove the `console.log`.
## Step 15
In programming, you will often need to work with lots of data. There are many data structures that can help you organize and manage your data. One of the most basic data structures is an array.

An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.

Arrays are denoted using square brackets (`[]`). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:
```js
let array = [];
```
Declare a `rows` variable and assign it an empty array.
## Step 16
When an array holds values, or elements, those values are separated by commas. Here is an array that holds two strings:
```js
let array = ["first", "second"];
```
Change your `rows` declaration to be an array with the strings `"Naomi"`, `"Quincy"`, and `"CamperChan"`. The order of values in an array is important, so follow that order. Remember that strings are case-sensitive.
## Step 17
You can access the values inside an array using the *index* of the value. An index is a number representing the position of the value in the array, starting from `0` for the first value.

You can access the value using bracket notation, such as `array[0]`.

Use `console.log` and bracket notation to print the first value in your `rows` array.
## Step 18
Arrays are special in that they are considered *mutable*. This means you can change the value at an index directly.

For example, this code would assign the number `25` to the second element in the array:
```js
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array[1] = 25;
console.log(array); // prints [1, 25, 3]
```
Update the **third** element of your `rows` array to be the number `10`. Then print the `rows` array to your console.
## Step 19
Notice how the value inside your `rows` array has been changed directly? This is called *mutation*. As you learn more about arrays, you will learn when to mutate an array, and when you should not.

Before moving on, this is a great opportunity to learn a common array use. Currently, your code accesses the last element in the array with `rows[2]`. But you may not know how many elements are in an array when you want the last one.

You can make use of the `.length` property of an array - this returns the number of elements in the array. To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:
```js
array[array.length - 1]
```
`array.length` returns the number of elements in the array. By subtracting `1`, you get the index of the last element in the array. You can apply this same concept to your `rows` array.

Update your `rows[2]` to dynamically access the last element in the rows array. Refer to the example above to help you.

You should not see anything change in your console.
## Step 20
For now, remove your first console log and your rows`[rows.length - 1]` assignment. Leave the second `rows` log statement for later.
#  Step 21 - 30
## Step 21
A *method* in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the `.log()` method, which is part of the `console` object.

Arrays have their own methods, and the first you will explore is the `.push()` method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number `12` to the end of an array:
```js
array.push(12);
```
Use `.push()` to add the string `"freeCodeCamp"` to the end of your `rows` array. Add this code before your `console.log` so you can see the change you made to your array.
## Step 22
Another method essential for this project is the `.pop()` method. It removes the last element from an array and *returns* that element.

When a method returns a value, you can think of it as giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code.

Create a new variable called `popped` and assign it the result of `rows.pop()`. Then, log `popped` to the console.
## Step 23
You should see the string `"freeCodeCamp"` logged to the console. This is because `.pop()` returns the value that was removed from the array - and you pushed `"freeCodeCamp"` to the end of the array earlier.

But what does `.push()` return? Assign your existing `rows.push()` to a new `pushed` variable, and log it.
## Step 24
Were you expecting to see `4` in the console? `.push()` returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.

It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with `.push()` and `.pop()`. When you are ready, remove all of your `.push()` and `.pop()` calls, and your `console.log` statements.
## Step 25
Change your `rows` declaration to be assigned an empty array again.

Also, change your `'Hello'` string to use double quotes again. Generally, it does not matter which of the two you prefer, but you will want to be consistent in that choice throughout your project.
## Step 26
Declaring a variable with the `let` keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change `character` later to be a completely different value.

For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use `const` to declare them. `const` variables are special.

First, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned like a `let` variable. This code would throw an error:
```js
const firstName = "Naomi";
firstName = "Jessica";
```
A `const` variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:
```js
const firstName;
```
Replace your `let` keywords with `const`.
## Step 27
You are now ready to start building your pyramid generator. Your `character` variable will serve as the building block for the pyramid.

`"Hello"` might not work very well for that. Change the value of character to be the hash character `"#"`.
## Step 28
To generate a pyramid, you will need to create multiple rows. When you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you will use a *loop*. There are many ways to write a loop.

You are going to start with a basic `for` loop. `for` loops use the following syntax:
```js
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
```
In the upcoming steps, you'll explore each component of a loop in detail. For now, construct a `for` loop that includes the terms `"iterator"`, `"condition"`, and `"iteration"` for the three components. Keep the loop *body*, the section within the curly braces {}, empty.
## Step 29
Your loop now needs a proper iterator. The *iterator* is a variable you can declare specifically in your `for` loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

It is a common convention to use `i` as your iterator variable in a loop. A `for` loop allows you to declare this in the parentheses `()`. For example, here is a `for` loop that declares an `index` variable and assigns it the value `100`.
```js
for (let index = 100; "second"; "third") {

}
```
Replace the string `"iterator"` with a let declaration for the variable `i`. Assign it the value `0` to start. This will give the `i` variable the value `0` the **first time** your loop runs.
## Step 30
The *condition* of a `for` loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the `condition` becomes false, the loop will stop.

In JavaScript, a Boolean value can be either `true` or `false`. These are not strings - you will learn more about the difference later on.

For now, you will use the less than operator (`<`). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. For example, `count < 3` would evaluate to `true` if `count` is `2`, and `false` if `count` is `4`.

Replace your `"condition"` string with a condition to check if `i` is less than `count`.
#  Step 31 - 40
## Step 31
Your *iteration* statement will tell your loop what to do with the iterator after each run.

When you reassign a variable, you can use the variable to reference the previous value before the reassignment. This allows you to do things like add three to an existing number. For example, bees = bees + 3; would increase the value of bees by three.

Use that syntax to replace your "iteration" string with a reassignment statement that increases i by one.
## Step 32
Your loop should now run eight times. Inside the body of the loop, print the value of the `i` iterator and see what happens.
## Step 33
You should see the numbers zero through seven printed in your console, one per line. This will serve as the foundation for generating your pyramid.

Replace your log statement with a statement to push `i` to your `rows` array.
## Step 34
Unfortunately, now you cannot see what your loop is doing.

Use `let` to declare a `result` variable, and assign it an empty string. An empty string is represented by quotation marks with nothing between them, such as `""`.
## Step 35
Add a log statement to print the value of `result`. Depending on which console you use, you may not see anything printed.
## Step 36
To manipulate the `result` string, you will use a different type of loop. Specifically, a `for...of` loop, which iterates over each item in an iterable object and temporarily assigns it to a variable.

The syntax for a `for...of` loop looks like:
```js
for (const value of iterable) {}
```
Note that you can use `const` because the variable only exists for a single iteration, not during the entire loop.

Create a `for...of` loop to iterate through your `rows` array, assigning each value to a `row` variable.
## Step 37
Remember in your previous loop that you used the addition operator `+` to increase the value of `i` by `1`.

You can do a similar thing with a string value, by appending a new string to an existing string. For example, `hello = hello + " World";` would add the string `" World"` to the existing string stored in the `hello` variable. This is called *concatenation*.

In your `for...of` loop, use the addition operator to concatenate the `row` value to the `result` value.
## Step 38
Now all of your numbers are appearing on the same line. This will not work for creating a pyramid.

You will need to add a new line to each row. However, pressing the return key to insert a line break between quotes in JavaScript will result in a parsing error. Instead, you need to use the special escape sequence `\n`, which is interpreted as a new line when the string is logged. For example:
```js
lineOne = lineOne + "\n" + lineTwo;
```
Use a second addition operator to concatenate a new line between the existing `result` value and the added `row` value.
## Step 39
Printing numbers won't result in a visually appealing pyramid. Now that you're outputting the formatted content of your `rows` array, it's time to update your original loop.

Instead of pushing `i` to the array, push the value of your `character` variable.
## Step 40
Now you have a series of `#` characters, but the pyramid shape is still missing. Fortunately, the `i` variable represents the current "row" number in your loop, enabling you to use it for crafting a pyramid-like structure.

To achieve this, you will use the `.repeat()` method available to strings. This method accepts a number as an argument, specifying the number of times to repeat the target string. For example, using `.repeat()` to generate the string `"Code! Code! Code!"`:
```js
const activity = "Code! ";
activity.repeat(3);
```
Use the `.repeat()` method on your `character`, and give it `i` for the number.
#  Step 41 - 50
## Step 41
You're getting closer! At this point, you're encountering what's known as an _off-by-one error_, a frequent problem in zero-based indexing languages like JavaScript.

The first index of your `rows` array is 0, which is why you start your `for` loop with `i = 0`. But repeating a string zero times results in nothing to print.

To fix this, add `1` to the value of `i` in your `.repeat()` call. Do not assign it back to `i` like you did in your loop conditions.
## Step 42
The logic for formatting this pyramid is likely going to get complicated, which means it's a great time to extract that code into a function.

A *function* is a block of code that can be reused throughout your application. Functions are declared with the following syntax:
```js
function name(parameter) {}
```
The `function` keyword tells JavaScript that the `name` variable is going to be a function. `parameter` is a variable that represents a value that is passed into the function when it is used. A function may have as many, or as few, *parameters* as you'd like. Like a `for` loop, the space between the curly braces is the *function* body.

Declare a `padRow` function. Do not create any parameter variables yet. The function body should be empty. Remember that you need to use camel case for your naming convention.
## Step 43
In order to use a function, you need to call it. A *function call* tells your application to run the code from the function wherever you choose to call it. The syntax for a function call is the function name followed by parentheses. For example, this code defines and calls a `test` function.
```js
function test() {}
test();
```
Call your `padRow` function.
## Step 44
You are calling your `padRow` function, but not doing anything with that function call. All functions in JavaScript *return* a value, meaning they provide the defined result of calling them for you to use elsewhere.

To see the result of calling your `padRow` function, declare a `call` variable and assign your existing `padRow` call to that variable.
## Step 45
Now add a log statement to print the value of your `call` variable.
## Step 46
Your `call` variable has an `undefined` value, even though you defined it! This is because your `padRow` function does not currently return a value. By default, functions return `undefined` as their value.

In order to return something else, you need to use the `return` keyword. Here is an example of a function that returns the string `"Functions are cool!"`:
```js
function demo() {
  return "Functions are cool!";
}
```
Use the `return` keyword to have your function return the string `"Hello!"`.
## Step 47
When you have a value that is explicitly written in your code, like the `"Hello!"` string in your function, it is considered to be hard-coded. Hard-coding a value inside a function might not make it as reusable as you'd like.

Instead, you can define *parameters* for the function. Parameters are special variables that are given a value when you call the function, and can be used in your function to dynamically change the result of the function's code.

To add a parameter to your function, you need to add a variable name inside the parentheses. For example, this `demo` function has a `name` parameter:
```js
function demo(name) {}
```
`name` sounds like a useful parameter, so go ahead and add it to your `padRow` function.
## Step 48
A function does not have to return a hard-coded value. It can return the value stored in a variable. Parameters are special variables for a function, so they can also be returned.

Change your `padRow` function to `return` the `name` parameter directly.
## Step 49
If you open your console again, you'll see that your `padRow` function is returning `undefined`, even though you defined a return value! This is because parameters need to be given a value when you **call** the function.

When you pass a value to a function call, that value is referred to as an *argument*. Here is an example of calling a `demo` function and passing `"Naomi"` as the argument for the `name` parameter.
```js
function demo(name) {
  return name;
}
demo("Naomi");
```
Pass your own name as the argument for the `name` parameter in your `padRow` call. Remember that your name is a string, so you'll need to use quotes.
## Step 50
Variables in JavaScript are available in a specific *scope*. In other words, where a variable is declared determines where in your code it can be used.

The first scope is the global scope. Variables that are declared outside of any "block" like a function or `for` loop are in the *global scope*. Your `character`, `count`, and `rows` variables are all in the global scope.

When a variable is in the global scope, a function can access it in its definition. Here is an example of a function using a global `title` variable:
```js
const title = "Professor ";
function demo(name) {
  return title + name;
}
demo("Naomi")
```
This example would return `"Professor Naomi"`. Update your `padRow` function to return the value of concatenating your `character` variable to the beginning of the `name` parameter.
#  Step 51 - 60
## Step 51
Variables can also be declared inside a function. These variables are considered to be in the `local scope`, or `block scope`. A variable declared inside a function can only be used inside that function. If you try to access it outside of the function, you will either get `undefined` or an error.

To see this in action, use `const` to declare a `test` variable in your `padRow` function. Initialize it with the value `"Testing"`.

Then, below your function, try to log `test` to the console. You will see an error because it is not defined outside of the function's local scope. Remove that `console.log` to pass the tests and continue.
## Step 52
There is a bit of a problem, here. Your `test` declaration is currently after your `return` statement. An important thing to know about the `return` keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your function code. This means that any code after a `return` statement will not run.

Move your `test` initialization to the line above your `return` statement.
## Step 53
If you try to add a `console.log(test)` call below your `padRow` function, you would see an error. This is because test is defined in the local scope, meaning you cannot access it in the global scope (outside of the `padRow` function).

Returning a value from a function brings that value into the scope where the function was called. To bring your `"Testing"` value from the `padRow` function into the global scope, update your `return` statement to return only the `test` variable.
## Step 54
Now your `call` variable has the value `"Testing"`. But your function is no longer using the `name` parameter.

Remove the `name` parameter from your function declaration, then remove your `"CamperChan"` string from the padRow call.
## Step 55
Because your function was no longer using the parameter, changing the value passed in the call did not affect it.

Go ahead and remove the `test` declaration from your `padRow` function. Also, remove the `return` statement, so your function is empty again.
## Step 56
As expected, your function now returns `undefined` again. Your `call` variable is not necessary any more, so remove the `call` declaration and the `console.log` for the `call` variable.
