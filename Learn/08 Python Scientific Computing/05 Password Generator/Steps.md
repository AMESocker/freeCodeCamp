Step 1Passed
A Python module is a file containing code designed to perform specific tasks. The Python standard library contains many modules that you can import and use in your code. You can achieve this by using the import statement followed by the name of the module.

Start this project by importing the string module.
Step 2Passed
You can access the utilities defined inside the imported module through the dot notation. The dot notation works by appending a dot followed by the utility name to the module name. For example, here's how to access the `ascii_lowercase` constant:
```
  import string


  print(string.ascii_lowercase)
  # Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

In this project, you are going to use different constants from the `string` module.

Declare a new variable called `letters` and assign `string.ascii_letters` to this variable.
